# Console-Finances

* The total number of months included in the dataset:
    Initialized a variable to hold it. Months amount equals length of value entries.

* Profit/Losses over the entire period:
    Need to be sum form an array of arrays - numbers/money values should be accessed and added

* SUM start from 0 and will store the total sum

* Variables to hold array elements created

* Loops through the whole array first, next through the inner arrays looking for money values
    when number value found to sum=0 adds money values of each nested array.
    Prints sum.




* To calculate averageChange used random Math.round(( Total / (finances.length - 1)) * 100) / 100;




















________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

INFO:
- a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses


TASK:
- to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

   > The total number of months included in the dataset.

    The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

    The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

            You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.

            (Total/(Number of months - 1))

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

    The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

 
 
+ use concatenation.
+ How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
